In settings.py,\n\nREST_FRAMEWORK.DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES\n should be set to\n\n'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication'\n\n\nDisable the authorization service. In settings.py, set \nOZP.USE_AUTH_SERVER\n\nto \nFalse\n\n\nIn settings.py, set \nOZP.DEMO_APP_ROOT\n to \nlocalhost:8000\n (or wherever\nthe django app will be served at)\n\n\n\n\nThen, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nInstall Python 3.4.3. Python can be installed by downloading the appropriate\n    files \nhere\n. Note\n    that Python 3.4 includes both \npip\n and \nvenv\n, a built-in replacement\n    for the \nvirtualenv\n package\n\n\nCreate a new python environment using python 3.4.x. First, create a new\n    directory where this environment will live, for example, in\n    \n~/python_envs/ozp\n. Now create a new environment there:\n    \npython3.4 -m venv ENV\n (where \nENV\n is the path you used above)\n\n\nActive the new environment: \nsource ENV/bin/activate\n\n\nInstall the necessary dependencies into this python environment:\n    \npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nRun the server: \nmake dev\n\n\n\n\nSwagger documentation for the api is available at \nhttp://localhost:8000/docs/\n\nUse username \nwsmith\n password \npassword\n when prompted for authentication info\n\n\nThere's also the admin interface at \nhttp://localhost:8000/admin\n\n(username: \nwsmith\n, password: \npassword\n)\n\n\nozp-ansible method\n\n\nFor those who just want to get OZP (Center, HUD, Webtop, IWC) up and running, see the\n\nquickstart\n of the \nozp-ansible\n project.\n\n\nThe recommended approach is to use the vagrant box referenced at the beginning\nof this README, which will create a production-esque deployment of OZP:\n\n\n\n\nPostgres (vs. SQLite)\n\n\nPKI (vs. HTTP Basic Auth)\n\n\nUse of external authorization service\n\n\nEnable HTTPS (via nginx reverse proxy)\n\n\nServed via Gunicorn (vs. Django development server)\n\n\n\n\nRuning Elasticsearch for Search\n\n\nozp/Settings.py file variable needs to be updated to \nES_ENABLED = True\n  \n\nAfter installing Elasticsearch run \nmake reindex_es\n and run \nmake run_es\n in the ozp-backend folder while inside of your $env     \n\n\nInstalling and Running Elasticsearch\n\n\nozp-backend requires Elasticsearch 2.4.1  \n\n\nInstallation Guide for 2.4.1\n\n\nThe requirement for installing Elasticsearch is Java 7.  \n\nPreferably, you should install the latest version of the official Java from www.java.com.    \n\n\nYou can get the Elasticsearch 2.4.1 from https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-2-4-1-released.  \n\nTo install Elasticsearch, download and extract the archive file for your platform.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve extracted the archive file, Elasticsearch is ready to run.   \n\n\nBelow are the commands:\n\n\nwget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/tar/elasticsearch/2.4.1/elasticsearch-2.4.1.tar.gz\ntar xvf elasticsearch-2.4.1.tar.gz\ncd elasticsearch-2.4.1\n./bin/elasticsearch\n\n\n\n\nTip\n  \n\nWhen installing Elasticsearch in production, you can choose to use the Debian or RPM packages provided on the downloads page.  \n\nYou can also use the officially supported Puppet module, Chef cookbook, or Ansible.    \n\n\nReleasing\n\n\nRun \npython release.py\n to generate a tarball with Wheels for the application\nand all of its dependencies.

For\nsimple cases like this, Serializer fields can be marked as \nread_only\n or\n\nwrite_only\n (\nread_only\n fields will not become part of the serializer's\n\nvalidated_data\n). If more control than this is needed (e.g. very different input\nand output formats), the \nget_serializer_class()\n method can be overridden\nin the View and selected dynamically based on request.method (\nPOST\n, \nGET\n,\netc).\n\n\nFor details regarding input vs output serializers:\n\n https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/issues/1563\n\n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17551380/python-rest-framwork-different-serializers-for-input-and-output-of-service\n\n\nSometimes it might not be clear where the Serializer classes should live for\nnested objects. For example, the listing resource needs to serialize the nested\nAgency model - should that Agency serializer live in the listing resource\npackage or in the agency package? Generally speaking, if the serializer is\nvery generic, it should live in its respective resource package. If instead\nit's highly customized (and thus unlikely to be used by other resources), it\nshould live with its nested resource.\n\n\nOne annoyance with nested serializers is that, if doing a create/POST, DRF\nassumes that each nested resource should also be created. This causes validation\nerrors to be raised when doing things like creating a new listing with an\nexisting category, listing type, etc. The way around that problem is to\nexplicitly remove all validation on any nested serializer fields that have\nunique constraints. For example, for a serializer with a \ntitle\n field:\n\n\nextra_kwargs = {\n    'title': {'validators': []}\n}\n\n\n\n\nBecause we don't want to remove the validator for the base resource (only when\nit's used in a nested fashion), some of the more complicated resources (namely\nListing) have lots of nested serializers that are identical to their non-nested\ncounterparts save for the removal of the unique field validators\n\n\nModel Access and Caching\n\n\nmodel_access.py\n files should be used to encapsulate more complex database\nqueries and business logic (as opposed to placing it in Views and Serializers).\nThese methods are easier to use in sample data generators, easier to test,\nand allows the complexity of Django Rest Framework to stay largely separate\nfrom the core application logic\n\n\nMemcache is not currently used, but this is also the layer to implement\nobject/query caching, such as:\n\n\ndata = cache.get('stuff')\nif data is None:\n    data = list(Stuff.objects.all())\n    cache.set('stuff', data)\nreturn data\n\n\n\n\nNote that we also need logic to invalidate specific caches when resources are\nmodified. For example, if a Listing is updated, all cached items referring/using\nthat listing's data should be invalidated. By far and large, this logic is not\nyet in place, so enabling the cache will likely lead to unexpected results.\nIn addition, the requirement to support 'tailored views' reduces the value\nof caching, since most queries must be filtered against a user's particular\naccess controls\n\n\nModels\n\n\nRegarding \n__str__()\n:\nIt\u2019s important to add \n__str__()\n methods to your models, not only for your own\nconvenience when dealing with the interactive prompt, but also because objects\u2019\nrepresentations are used throughout Django\u2019s automatically-generated admin.\nNote that on Python 2, \n__unicode__()\n should be defined instead.\n\n\nBy default, fields cannot be null or blank\n\n\nSome of the access control logic necessary to support tailored views lives\nin \nmodels.py\n as custom \nmodels.Manager\n classes (Reviews, Listings,\nListingActivities, and Images)\n\n\nViews\n\n\nWe generally prefer to\nuse class-based views and \nViewSet\ns (\nModelViewSet\ns in particular) just\nbecause it's less code (assuming you don't require a significant amount of\ncustomization)\n\n\nThe use of the convenience method \nget_object_or_404\n breaks the encapsulation\nof database queries in the \nmodel_access\n files (and prevents caching). That\nmight be something to look at later on.\n\n\nURLs\n\n\nAll resource endpoints are defined in the resource's respective \nurls.py\n in\n\nozpcenter/api/\n. \nozpcenter.urls\n collects all of these endpoints, where they\nare given the \napi/\n prefix in the global \nurls.py\n\n\nDRF uses a browsable API, meaning that you can go to\n\nlocalhost:8000/api/metadata/\n (for instance) in your browser. In general, the\nSwagger documentation is the recommended way to view and interact with the API.\n\n\nAll URLs are currently set to use a trailing \n/\n\n\nAuthentication and Authorization\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAuthentication and authorization is based on the default \ndjango.contrib.auth\n\nsystem built into Django, with numerous customizations.\n\n\nThe default User model is extended by giving the \nProfile\n model a one-to-one\nrelationship with the \ndjango.contrib.auth.models.User\n model, as described\n\nhere\n\n\nThe default \nUser\n\nmodel has the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nfirst_name\n\n\nlast_name\n\n\nemail\n\n\npassword\n\n\ngroups (many-to-many relationship to Group)\n\n\nuser_permissions (many-to-many relationship to Permission)\n\n\nis_staff (Boolean. Designates whether this user can access the admin site)\n\n\nis_active (Boolean. Designates whether this user account should be considered\n    active)\n\n\nis_superuser (Boolean. Designates that this user has all permissions without\n    explicitly assigning them)\n\n\nlast_login (a datetime of the user's last login)\n\n\ndate_joined (a datetime designating when the account was created)\n\n\n\n\nOf these fields:\n\n\n\n\nfirst_name and last_name are not used\n\n\nis_superuser is always set to False\n\n\nis_staff is set to True for Org Stewards and Apps Mall Stewards\n\n\npassword is only used in development. On production, client SSL certs are\n    used, and so password is set to XXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nGroups\n are\nused to categorize users as Users, Org Stewards, Apps Mall Stewards, etc. These\ngroups are used to partially control access to various resources (for example,\nUsers cannot make modifications to the Categories). That said, the majority\nof 'access control' cannot be accomplished by creating generic permissions\nand groups. For example, an Org Steward should be able to approve a Listing only\nfor organizations to which they belong. Furthermore, any resources (Listings,\nImages) that have a specific access_control associated with them must be\nhidden from users (regardless of role/group) without the appropriate level\nof access.\n\n\nDjango Permissions are used to control access to the Admin site. By default,\nadd, change, and delete permissions are added to each model in the application.\nThe notion of separate permissions for these three operations don't make much\nsense for this application - for now, the default permissions will be left\nalone, but the Permissions infrastructure won't be used much beyond that. As\npreviously stated, it is not possible to create generic permissions that can\nbe statically assigned to users, like 'can_approve_listing', since the\nallowance of such an action depends on the object (model instance), not just the\nmodel type. Therefore, custom object-level permissions will typically be used\nto control access to specific resource instances (for both read and write\noperations). For list queries where multiple resources are returned, these\nobject-level permission checks are not used. Instead, filters and custom\nquerysets are used to ensure only the appropriate data is returned.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nThe app currently supports two forms of authentication - HTTP Basic Auth and\nPKI (client SSL authentication). HTTP Basic Auth is used for development\npurposes only. PKI authentication is implemented in \nozpcenter/auth/pkiauth.py\n.\nThe method of authentication to use is controlled by\n\nREST_FRAMEWORK.DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES\n in settings.py\n\n\nTests\n\n\nGenerally speaking, each resource (listing, agency, profile, etc) may have\ntwo types of tests: business logic tests and API tests. The former typically\ntests code in \nmodel_access.py\n files, which is pure Python code and independent\nof Django or any \"web stuff\". The latter API tests, on the other hand, actually\nmake HTTP requests using special testing clients and factories, and are more\nlike end-to-end or integration tests\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nSystem uses Postgres in Production and Sqlite3 in Development\n\n\nAPI Documentation\n\n\nThere are a number of different documentation resources available, depending\non what you're looking for.\n\n\nDRF's Web Browsable API can be accessed by entering an endpoint in the browser,\nfor example, \nrootUrl\n/api/profile/\n.  Limitations:\n * the API Root doesn't have a list of all endpoints, so you need to know\n what you're looking for\n * although these pages include forms that could potentially support POST\n requests, they don't work very well, making the browsable API mostly useless\n for non-GET requests\n\n\nSwagger docs are created via Django REST Swagger and served at\n \nrootUrl\n/docs/\n. Swagger makes it easy to see all of the endpoints available.\n Unlike the Browsable API docs, Swagger supports POST, PUT, and DELETE for most\n of the endpoints as well. Limitations:\n  * POST api/image/ doesn't work from Swagger\n  * some of the more complicated endpoints (like POST api/listing/) might not\n  have forms that show all of the required and/or optional data that must or\n  could be included in the request\n\n\nPostman was used extensively during the API's development, and perhaps someday\n a Postman Collection of requests will be added to this repo\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nCurrently, a single logger (\nozp-center\n) is used throughout the application.\nSee \nsettings.py\n for details\n\n\nStatic and Media Files\n\n\nStatic files: JS, CSS, fonts, etc. Media files: images uploaded during app\nusage. Good explanation \nhere\n\n\nStatic files include html/css/js for:\n * Django admin site\n * DRF Browsable API\n * Swagger docs\n\n\nMedia files (uploaded images) have associated access controls that require\nenforcement on a per-user basis. For that reason, media files are not served\nstatically as they typically are, but instead served by the wsgi app itself\n\n\nScripts\n\n\nThe \nrunscript\n command is installed via the django-extensions package and used\nto run scripts in the django context, just as you would get by running a set\nof commands in the shell using \npython manage.py shell\n.   \n\nThis can be used to run the script to populate the database with sample data: \n\n\npython manage.py runscript sample_data_generator\n.   \n\nSee the \ndocs\n for\ndetails\n\n\nAPI Input\n\n\nAll POST, PUT, and PATCH endpoints should use JSON encoded input as per\n\nthis\n\n\nDjango Admin Site\n\n\nThe admin site is currently enabled in development (but will likely be\ndisabled in production). It is accessible by both Apps Mall Stewards and\nOrg Stewards. It has a number of limitations, including the inability to upload\nimages (since images aren't stored in the database), and the fact that many\noperations (like editing reviews, approving listings, etc) should result in\nadditional operations (like creating ListingActivity entries), but using\nthe Admin interface directly bypasses that logic",

The default User model is extended by giving the  Profile  model a one-to-one\nrelationship with the  django.contrib.auth.models.User  model, as described here  The default  User \nmodel has the following fields:   username  first_name  last_name  email  password  groups (many-to-many relationship to Group)  user_permissions (many-to-many relationship to Permission)  is_staff (Boolean. Designates whether this user can access the admin site)  is_active (Boolean. Designates whether this user account should be considered\n    active)  is_superuser (Boolean. Designates that this user has all permissions without\n    explicitly assigning them)  last_login (a datetime of the user's last login)  date_joined (a datetime designating when the account was created)   Of these fields:   first_name and last_name are not used  is_superuser is always set to False  is_staff is set to True for Org Stewards and Apps Mall Stewards  password is only used in development. On production, client SSL certs are\n    used, and so password is set to XXXXXXXX   Groups  are\nused to categorize users as Users, Org Stewards, Apps Mall Stewards, etc. These\ngroups are used to partially control access to various resources (for example,\nUsers cannot make modifications to the Categories). That said, the majority\nof 'access control' cannot be accomplished by creating generic permissions\nand groups. For example, an Org Steward should be able to approve a Listing only\nfor organizations to which they belong. Furthermore, any resources (Listings,\nImages) that have a specific access_control associated with them must be\nhidden from users (regardless of role/group) without the appropriate level\nof access.  Django Permissions are used to control access to the Admin site. By default,\nadd, change, and delete permissions are added to each model in the application.\nThe notion of separate permissions for these three operations don't make much\nsense for this application - for now, the default permissions will be left\nalone, but the Permissions infrastructure won't be used much beyond that. As\npreviously stated, it is not possible to create generic permissions that can\nbe statically assigned to users, like 'can_approve_listing', since the\nallowance of such an action depends on the object (model instance), not just the\nmodel type. Therefore, custom object-level permissions will typically be used\nto control access to specific resource instances (for both read and write\noperations). For list queries where multiple resources are returned, these\nobject-level permission checks are not used. Instead, filters and custom\nquerysets are used to ensure only the appropriate data is returned.",
